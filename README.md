### Hi, I'm Philipp 👋

I'm a researcher and data scientist with a focus on computer vision at BI X - an Research & Innovation Lab of pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim. 

- 🎓 I studied Engineering and Policy Analysis at Delft University of Technology. More than 5 years ago, before Tensorflow was released, I already used deep learning with the open-source framework [caffee](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org). My team and I explored which aesthetic properties a CNN classifier learns from the rankings of a photo competition.
- 🌱 I’m currently reading [Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
- 📝 I'm currently working on a publication on a novel deep learning model-architecture for detecting Velcro crackles in lung auscultation recordings, a key finding in patients with IPF.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a medical computer vision competition on kaggle.

I'm best reached via [email](philippschw@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
